# Serial Port Plotter

This is a Windows application that displays real time data from serial port. I had to create it for a project and I would like to put the code here so more people could use it. The application is 32-bit and built with Qt and QCustomPlot library. It can plot up to three axes and 1000 data points. Plot refresh rate is 20 Hz, independent of incoming data frequency. It can also export JPG with the plot.

The application supports zooming and dragging using the mouse wheel. Clicking anywhere in the plot displays the X and Y values of the graph in the status bar.
